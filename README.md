## Goals
- Create a fun and engaging platform-fighting game.
- Implement a variety of characters with unique abilities and playstyles.
- Showcase my Python's abilities in clean/efficient code.
- Eventually create a multiplayer mode, through networking and sockets.
- Open-source the project to allow for community contributions and feedback.
- Apply reinforcement learning to train AI opponents.
